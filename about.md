I'm **Ash Wilson**, a Developer Support Engineer at [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com/). Basically, that means that I help people build awesome things, build awesome things of my own, and provide support for Rackspace SDKs and APIs.

I have particular interests in:

 * *DadOps*
 * *developer tooling*
 * *open-source software*
 * *programming language design*
 * *making software engineering process effective without being painful*
 * *automating everything you can automate*
 * *making chat bots do silly and useful things*
 * *plugging things into other things to see what happens*
 * *artificial intelligence*
 * *cooking*
 * *running*
 * *writing bad science fiction and fantasy*

When the fancy strikes me, I may blog about some of these things.

I'm a bit of a polyglot when it comes to programming languages. Since we're already doing the "about section" thing, here's the list, as it stands.

**Active set languages** that are resident in my memory. I should be able to pick these up and start coding with minimal "wait what's that standard library function" moments.

*Ruby*, *Python*, *Smalltalk*, *C*, *Go*, *JavaScript*, *CoffeeScript*, *Java*, *Scala*

**Languages I've known well** are the ones that I've built something more substantial than a tutorial with in the recent past. I might need a little refresher before I could get going again.

*C++*, *Lisp*

**Languages I've read about** but haven't really properly put through their paces yet.

*C#*

The **dusty corners of my brain** are for languages I haven't touched for years and major versions.

*Perl*, *PHP*, *Visual Basic*

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hossain Mohd. Faysal's HMFAYASAL V2 theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hmfaysal-v2-theme/) because it looks quite slick and lets me work on mobile without having to do any extra hacking around.
